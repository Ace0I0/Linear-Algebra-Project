# Linear Algebra Project

This project demonstrates how linear algebra, specifically matrix transformations, is used in real-world applications. We showcase these concepts through a short video game that highlights how matrix transformations contribute to in-game animations and mechanics.

## Technologies Used

- **Pygame** – For game development and rendering
- **Pytmx** – For handling tile maps
- **Tiled** – For putting together in-game maps
- *(More packages may be added later as development progresses.)*

## Installation

To run this project, install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pygame-ce
pip install pytmx
```
To run this program, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python test.py
```



## Extras

Since test.py was developed on a personal machine, the file paths for the tile map and character sprites are set up locally. If you are testing this project on your own machine, ensure that you update the file paths accordingly, or the game will not run properly.
