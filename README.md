# Linear Algebra Project

This project demonstrates how linear algebra, specifically matrix transformations, is used in real-world applications. We showcase these concepts through a short video game that highlights how matrix transformations contribute to in-game animations and mechanics.

## Technologies Used

- **Pygame** – For game development and rendering
- **Pytmx** – For handling tile maps
- **Tiled** – For putting together in-game maps
- **Procreate** - For creating sprites and tiles
- *(More packages may be added later as development progresses.)*

## Installation

To run this project, install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pygame-ce
pip install pytmx
```
To run test.py, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python test.py
```
